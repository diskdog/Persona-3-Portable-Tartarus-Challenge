# Persona-3-Portable-Tartarus-Challenge

This is a save file for Persona 3 Portable (US Version). The difficulty is set to Maniac.

* The Save File is for the Evening of January 1st (1 in-game month before the Final Boss).
* Tartarus has not been entered. As a result, the Player, and all Party Members, are level 1.
* Every Party Member has their Ultimate Persona, with 2 in each stat (St, Ma, En, Ag, Lu).
* Every Party Member is equipped with their starting equipment, except:
  * Ken is equipped with a Treason Couse (35 Attack instead of Cross Spear's 129 Attack)
  * Koromaru is equipped with a Kunai of Carnage (35 Attack instead of Sylph Blade's 129 Attack)
  * Aigis is equipped with an Orgilabeus (85 Attack instead of Albireo's 116 Attack. This is her weakest weapon, excluding Fused Weapons.)
* All Social Links are maxed out except for Judgement (which ranks up automatically on certain floors of Tartarus). The player is given all Key Items that are received by completing Social Links as a result.

You have 30 in-game days to climb 254 floors of Tartarus.
